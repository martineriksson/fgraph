Apologies to the original project: [jugend/fgraph](http://github.com/jugend/fgraph)

I compacted it from over 20 files to 2, to be able to mess around with it more easily:

* Merged all the core lib into a single file.

* Merged all of the tests into a single file.

* Generated YARD-documentation (one-file mode) to replace verbose comments.
